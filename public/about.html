<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Elah! I've been a Virtual Assitant for the past 4 years. I want to pursue Web Development so I can finally have a niche. This niche is pretty hard but i really wanted to learn. Praise God for this course Angela made. People like me who has zero coding knowledge can now start coding! </p>
<p>My favorite food is spaghetti. I recommend that you try Jollibee's spaghetti.</p>

<p>I have friends in Canada who treat me like a sibling. They're the reason I was able to pursue learning more skills.</p>
